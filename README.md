### I'm a huge fan of Pokemon so I decide to create my own Pokedex for Andoird.

This is a personal project. The presenting application will be composed by Fragments
through which you'll be able to navigate and see every Pokemon in detail.
It will also have a search bar to be able to locale you fave Pokemons really quickly!
